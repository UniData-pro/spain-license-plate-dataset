# License Plate Recognition Dataset
Dataset offers **116 237** images of vehicles featuring license plates from the USA, making it an excellent resource for tasks involving **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition), **license plate identification**, and **vehicle registration** data extraction. Each image is accompanied by a CSV file that provides the corresponding plate text and country code, ideal for developing and testing text recognition systems.

With this dataset, researchers and developers can build and refine solutions for **traffic analysis**, **transportation management**, and autonomous **vehicle technologies**. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/spain-license-plate-detection-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spain-license-plate-dataset)**

The collection includes metadata linking image file names with plate text and location information. The photos cover a variety of traffic situations, road types, and driving environments, providing a rich base for training and evaluating OCR models and AI systems.
